1. What is the lambda operator?
        ->
2. What is a functional interface?
        It is an interface which contains only one abstract method

3. How do functional interfaces and lambda expressions relate?
        lambda expressions used to implement abstract method of functional interfaces

4. What are the two general types of lambda expressions?
        > single
        > block

5. Show a lambda expression that returns true if a number is between 10 and 20, inclusive.
        (userInput) -> (userInput >= 10 && userInput <=20) ? true : false;

9. Using the program shown in Try This 14-1, create a lambda expression that removes
    all spaces from a string and returns the result. Demonstrate this method by passing it to
    changeStr( ).

10. Can a lambda expression use a local variable? If so, what constraint must be met?
        yes, can. Local variable should be final or effectively final.

11. If a lambda expression throws a checked exception, the abstract method in the functional
interface must have a throws clause that includes that exception. True or False?
        true
